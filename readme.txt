A complete replacement of the standard WooCommerce checkout page with a modernized design with easy navigation and the ability to easily customize styles. The purchase of goods will become phased and will be easier for customers to perceive, which will positively affect the number of orders placed.

Convenient settings allow you to set the company logo, as well as auxiliary links to inform the user about the terms of service, privacy, etc. The design is made as simple as possible and adaptive for all versions of devices. Immediately after activating the plugin, the checkout page will be changed. When disabled, it will return to normal.
